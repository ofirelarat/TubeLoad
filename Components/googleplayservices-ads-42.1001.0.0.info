The SDK enables mobile app developers to maximize their monetization in native mobile apps.\n\nRequired Android API Levels\n===========================\n\nWe recommend setting your app\u0027s *Target Framework* and *Target Android version* to **Android 5.0 (API Level 21)** or higher in your app project settings.\n\nThis Google Play Service SDK\u0027s requires a *Target Framework* of at least Android 4.1 (API Level 16) to compile.\n\nYou may still set a lower *Minimum Android version* (as low as Android 2.3 - API Level 9) so your app will run on older versions of Android, however you must ensure you do not use any API\u0027s at runtime that are not available on the version of Android your app is running on.\n\n\nAndroid Manifest \n================\n\nSome Google Play Services APIs require specific metadata, attributes, permissions or features to be declared in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file.\n\nThese can be added manually to the *AndroidManifest.xml* file, or merged in through the use of assembly level attributes.\n\n\nThe Google Mobile Ads SDK requires the *Internet* and *Access Network State* permissions to work correctly.  You can add these with the following assembly level attributes:\n\n```csharp\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.Internet)]\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.AccessNetworkState)]\n```\n\nYou must also declare an activity that exists in the SDK by manually adding the following element to your *AndroidManifest.xml* file, inside of the `\u003capplication\u003e` `\u003c/application\u003e` tags:\n\n```xml\n\u003cactivity android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.ads.AdActivity\"\n            android:configChanges=\"keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize\"\n            android:theme=\"@android:style/Theme.Translucent\" /\u003e\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nSamples\n=======\n\nYou can find a Sample Application within each Google Play Services component.  The sample will demonstrate the necessary configuration and some basic API usages.\n\n\n\nThe AdMobSample in this component demonstrates how to use various ad types from code and xml layouts.\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n==========\n\nYou can learn more about the various Google Play Services SDKs \u0026 APIs by visiting the official [Google APIs for Android][3] documentation\n\n\nYou can learn more about the Google Play Services Ad by visiting the official [AdMob for Android](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start) documentation.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://console.developers.google.com/ \"Google Developers Console\"\n[2]: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/MD5_SHA1/ \"Finding your SHA-1 Fingerprints\"\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/android/ \"Google APIs for Android\"\n[4]: https://firebase.google.com/console/ \"Firebase Developer Console\"\n[5]: https://firebase.google.com/ \"Firebase\"\n","Hash":"c5a92d4c4a74dc05f5d82c811364cbaf","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
